Thanks for taking time to share your thoughts about AI in teaching.\n\nThis is a hybrid survey that combines structured questions with the opportunity to elaborate when topics get complex. You'll see some traditional-style questions (ratings, True/False), but if your answers indicate nuance, I'll ask follow-up questions to understand better.\n\nThe survey has 6 sections and should take about 10-12 minutes. You can guide the conversation - say \"next question\" to move on, or ask me to revisit something.\n\nLet's start with your current experience with AI tools.\n\nWhich AI tools have you tried? (List any, or say 'none yet')",

      "content": "Great! You're clearly experienced with AI tools. I can see you have strong opinions about what works and what doesn't.\n\nLet's start with Section 1 - AI Awareness & Current Usage:\n\n1. How often do you currently use AI tools in your teaching or research? (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Rarely, Never)\n\n2. Which AI applications do you find most useful for your work? (You've mentioned several - feel free to elaborate on which ones you actually use for teaching/research)\n\n3. On a scale of 1-5, how comfortable are you with AI technology? (1=Very uncomfortable, 5=Very comfortable)\n\nYou can answer in any format that's comfortable - just your ratings/answers, or with explanations if you want to share more.",

      "content": "Ha! I appreciate the honesty - sounds like you're in the \"very uncomfortable but using it anyway\" camp. That's actually a fascinating position - using AI daily while being very uncomfortable with it.\n\nYou mentioned combining several tools in workflows - that sounds pretty sophisticated. Can you tell me more about what drives you to use AI daily despite being so uncomfortable with it? Is it necessity, curiosity, or something else?\n\nAnd what specifically makes you uncomfortable - the technology itself, how it works, potential implications, or something else?",

      "content": "Ah, that makes MUCH more sense! A 5 on comfort level - \"living a year into the future and bleeding code\" is a great way to put it.\n\nSo you're using AI daily, combining multiple tools in sophisticated workflows, and you're very comfortable with the technology. You mentioned trying to develop well-integrated workflows - that suggests you're thinking strategically about how these tools work together rather than just using them individually.\n\nWhat does one of your typical AI workflows look like? Are you chaining outputs from one tool into another, or using different tools for different parts of a process?",

That's exactly the kind of sophisticated multi-tool approach that shows real comfort with AI.\n\nThanks! Now let's look at Section 2 - Interest in AI for Teaching:\n\n1. How interested are you in incorporating AI tools into your teaching? (Scale 1-5, where 1=Not at all interested, 5=Very interested)\n\n2. Which teaching activities do you think could benefit most from AI? (Lesson planning, grading, creating materials, student feedback, research guidance, etc.)\n\n3.
