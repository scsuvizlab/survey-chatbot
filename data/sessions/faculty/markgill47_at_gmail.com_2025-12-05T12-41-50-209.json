Thanks for taking time to share your thoughts about AI in teaching.\n\nThis is a hybrid survey - I'll ask you questions one at a time, and when your answers indicate complexity or high interest, I'll ask follow-up questions to understand better.\n\nThe survey has 6 sections and typically takes 10-30 minutes depending on how much detail you want to provide. You're in control - you can keep responses brief or elaborate as much as you'd like.\n\nLet's start with your current experience with AI tools.\n\nWhich AI tools have you tried? (List any, or say 'none yet')",
