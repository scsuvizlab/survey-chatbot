Thanks for taking time to share your thoughts about AI in teaching.\n\nThis is a hybrid survey - I'll ask you questions one at a time, and when your answers indicate complexity or high interest, I'll ask follow-up questions to understand better.\n\nThe survey has 6 sections and typically takes 10-30 minutes depending on how much detail you want to provide. You're in control - you can keep responses brief or elaborate as much as you'd like.\n\nLet's start with your current experience with AI tools.\n\nWhich AI tools have you tried?
